# Ecommerce Crawler and Tester

This project automates the crawling and testing of a sample e-commerce website (e.g., Amazon India) using Selenium with Java.

---

## **Features**
1. **Basic Crawling**:
   - Extract product details (name, price, rating, and URL) from search results.
   - Save data to a CSV file (`outputs/products.csv`).

2. **Functional Testing**:
   - Validate product page elements:
     - "Add to Cart" button
     - Product description/specifications
     - Image gallery
   - Log results in `outputs/test_results.log`.

3. **Bonus Tasks**:
   - Crawl multiple pages of search results.
   - Simulate responsiveness by testing on different screen sizes.
